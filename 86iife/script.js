// The code you provided is an immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE) that demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `async/await` feature with promises. Let's break down the code step by step and explain what's happening in detail:

// ```javascript
// (async () => {
//   let b = await a();
//   console.log(b);
//   let c = await a();
//   console.log(c);
//   let d = await a();
//   console.log(d);
// })();
// ```

// 1. `(async () => { ... })`:
//    - This is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). It defines an anonymous async function and immediately invokes it. The `async` keyword indicates that the function contains asynchronous code that uses `await`.

// 2. `let b = await a()`:
//    - This line declares a variable `b` and uses the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until the promise returned by the function `a` is resolved. In this case, `a` is an asynchronous operation that resolves to `456` after a 4-second delay using `setTimeout`.
//    - Once the promise is resolved, the value `456` is assigned to `b`.

// 3. `console.log(b)`:
//    - This line logs the value of `b` to the console. In this case, it logs `456`.

// 4. `let c = await a()`:
//    - Similar to the first `await` line, this code waits for the promise returned by the function `a` to resolve. It assigns the resolved value to the variable `c`.

// 5. `console.log(c)`:
//    - This line logs the value of `c` to the console. It will also log `456` because the same asynchronous operation is awaited.

// 6. `let d = await a()`:
//    - Like the previous lines, this code awaits the resolution of the promise from the function `a` and assigns the resolved value to the variable `d`.

// 7. `console.log(d)`:
//    - This line logs the value of `d` to the console. It will log `456` once again because it's the same asynchronous operation that is awaited.

// In summary, this IIFE demonstrates the sequential execution of asynchronous operations using `await`. The `a` function returns a Promise that resolves to `456` after a 4-second delay. Each time the function is awaited, it pauses the execution of the IIFE until the Promise is resolved, and then the resolved value is logged to the console.

// The `await` keyword simplifies working with asynchronous code, making it appear more like synchronous code by pausing execution until the awaited operation completes. This can be particularly useful when dealing with asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from a server or waiting for user input.
