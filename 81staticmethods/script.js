// In JavaScript, a static method is a method that belongs to a class itself rather than to instances of the class. Unlike regular (instance) methods, static methods are called on the class itself, not on objects created from the class. Here are some key characteristics of static methods:

// 1. **Definition**:
//    - Static methods are defined within a class using the `static` keyword.

// 2. **Access**:
//    - Static methods are accessed through the class name, not through instances of the class.

// 3. **No Access to Instance-Specific Data**:
//    - Inside a static method, you do not have access to instance-specific data or the `this` keyword. This means you can't access instance properties or call other instance methods.

// 4. **Use Cases**:
//    - Static methods are often used for utility functions or operations related to the class but not specific to individual instances. They can be thought of as class-level operations.

// 5. **Examples of Static Methods**:
//    - Common use cases for static methods include creating factory methods to construct instances, performing calculations related to the class, and providing utility functions.

//    ```javascript
//    class MathUtils {
//      static add(a, b) {
//        return a + b;
//      }

//      static multiply(a, b) {
//        return a * b;
//      }
//    }

//    // Calling static methods
//    const sum = MathUtils.add(5, 3); // 8
//    const product = MathUtils.multiply(4, 6); // 24
//    ```

//    - In this example, `add` and `multiply` are static methods of the `MathUtils` class, and they are called on the class itself.

// 6. **When to Use Static Methods**:
//    - Use static methods when you have a function that is closely related to a class but doesn't need to operate on instance-specific data. It's a way to organize and encapsulate class-related functionality.

// Static methods in JavaScript provide a way to define class-level functionality and utility methods that don't depend on the state of individual instances. They are a useful tool for structuring and organizing code within classes.

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = Animal.capitalize(name)
  }
  walk() {
    alert("Animal " + this.name + " is walking")
  }
  static capitalize(name) {
    return name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1, name.length)
    // name.charAt(0) extracts the first character of the name string
    // .toUpperCase() is a method that converts a string to uppercase. In this context, it is applied to the first character of the string to capitalize it.
    // name.substr(1, name.length) extracts a substring of the name string starting from the second character (index 1) to the end of the string (determined by name.length).
    // This part of the string remains in its original case (not uppercase).



//     The provided code defines a static method called `capitalize` within a class. This static method is designed to capitalize the first letter of a string. Let's break down the code step by step:

// ```javascript
// static capitalize(name) {
//   return name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1, name.length);
// }
// ```

// 1. `static` Keyword:
//    - The `static` keyword is used to define a static method. Static methods belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They can be called on the class directly, and they typically perform operations related to the class but don't have access to instance-specific data.

// 2. `capitalize` Method:
//    - The `capitalize` method takes one parameter, `name`, which is the string you want to capitalize.

// 3. `name.charAt(0).toUpperCase()`:
//    - `name.charAt(0)` extracts the first character of the `name` string.
//    - `.toUpperCase()` is a method that converts a string to uppercase. In this context, it is applied to the first character of the string to capitalize it.

// 4. `name.substr(1, name.length)`:
//    - `name.substr(1, name.length)` extracts a substring of the `name` string starting from the second character (index 1) to the end of the string (determined by `name.length`).
//    - This part of the string remains in its original case (not uppercase).

// 5. Concatenation:
//    - The capitalized first letter and the remaining substring are concatenated using the `+` operator, resulting in a string with the first letter capitalized.

// Overall, this `capitalize` method effectively capitalizes the first letter of a given string while leaving the rest of the string's characters in their original case. This can be useful in various scenarios where you want to ensure consistent capitalization of text, such as capitalizing names or titles.

j = new Animal("jack")
j.walk()
// console.log(j.capitalize("thisa")) // --- > this doesnt work
