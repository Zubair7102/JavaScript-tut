// An event listener in JavaScript is a function or procedure that waits for a specific type of event to occur on a particular HTML element, and then it executes a designated function (or a block of code) in response to that event.




submit.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  // // This line of code is within an event handler function and is typically used in response to a form submission. It prevents the default behavior of the form submission, which is to reload the page. By calling e.preventDefault(), you ensure that the page doesn't refresh when the user submits the form. This allows you to handle the form submission using JavaScript instead of relying on a server request.

  let titlec = title.value
  // title.value:
  // title is assumed to be an HTML input element, possibly an input field with a value property.
  // title.value accesses the current value entered or stored in the title input element.
  let descc = desc.value
  localStorage.setItem("todo", JSON.stringify([titlec, descc]))
  // JSON.stringify([titlec, descc]) is a JavaScript expression that converts an array containing the values of titlec and descc into a JSON-formatted string.
  console.log(e)
  todo.innerHTML = `
  <h1>${titlec} </h1>
  <p> ${descc}</p>
  `
  title.value = ""
  desc.value = ""
  // title.value = "" and desc.value = "":
// These lines reset the values of the input elements with the ids "title" and "desc" to an empty string, effectively clearing the input fields after the user submits a to-do item.
})

deleteBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()

  localStorage.removeItem("todo")
  todo.innerHTML = ""
})



// The code you provided is written in JavaScript and appears to be part of a web page that allows the user to input and display to-do items, as well as delete them. It involves event listeners and the use of the `localStorage` feature in web browsers for storing data locally. Let's break down and explain this code step by step:

// 1. `submit.addEventListener("click", (e) => {...})`:
//    - This code attaches a click event listener to an HTML element with the id "submit." It listens for a click event and executes the provided arrow function when the element is clicked.

// 2. `e.preventDefault()`:
//    - The `e` parameter in the arrow function represents the event object generated when the submit button is clicked. The `e.preventDefault()` method is called to prevent the default behavior of a form submission. This is typically used when you have a form element with a submit button to prevent the page from refreshing when the submit button is clicked.

// 3. `let titlec = title.value` and `let descc = desc.value`:
//    - These lines extract the values of input elements with the ids "title" and "desc" and store them in the `titlec` and `descc` variables, respectively. These variables hold the title and description entered by the user.

// 4. `localStorage.setItem("todo", JSON.stringify([titlec, descc]))`:
//    - This line uses the `localStorage` object to store data locally in the user's web browser. It sets an item with the key "todo" and the value as a JSON-serialized array containing the `titlec` and `descc` values. This allows you to store to-do items locally on the user's device.

// 5. `console.log(e)`:
//    - This logs the event object `e` to the console. It's useful for debugging and understanding what happens when the submit button is clicked.

// 6. `todo.innerHTML = ...`:
//    - This line updates the HTML content of an element with the id "todo" with new content.
//    - It uses template literals to dynamically generate HTML content based on the `titlec` and `descc` values. It displays the entered title and description as an `h1` and `p` element, respectively.

// 7. `title.value = ""` and `desc.value = ""`:
//    - These lines reset the values of the input elements with the ids "title" and "desc" to an empty string, effectively clearing the input fields after the user submits a to-do item.

// 8. `deleteBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {...})`:
//    - This code attaches a click event listener to an HTML element with the id "deleteBtn." It listens for a click event and executes the provided arrow function when the element is clicked.

// 9. `localStorage.removeItem("todo")`:
//    - When the "deleteBtn" is clicked, this line removes the "todo" item from `localStorage`, effectively deleting the stored to-do item.

// 10. `todo.innerHTML = ""`:
//     - This clears the HTML content of the element with the id "todo," effectively removing any previously displayed to-do items from the page.

// In summary, this code allows the user to input and display to-do items on a web page. The items are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, and the user can delete them by clicking a "Delete" button. It's a basic example of client-side data storage and interaction with the DOM (Document Object Model).
