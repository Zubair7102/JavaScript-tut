let a = {
  name2: "Harry",
  language: "JavaScript",
  
}
console.log(a)

// The provided code defines an object named `a` and then logs the object's contents to the console. Here's the explanation of the code:

// ```javascript
// let a = {
//   name2: "Harry",
//   language: "JavaScript",
// }
// ```

// 1. `let a = { ... };`: This line declares and initializes an object named `a`. The object is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and contains two key-value pairs separated by colons. Each key represents a property name, and each value represents the property's value.

// 2. Properties:
//    - `name2: "Harry"`: This line defines a property named `name2` within the `a` object and assigns it the string value "Harry."
//    - `language: "JavaScript"`: This line defines another property named `language` within the `a` object and assigns it the string value "JavaScript."

// 3. `console.log(a)`: This line uses the `console.log()` function to output the contents of the object `a` to the console. When you run this code, you will see the object `a` and its properties displayed in the console.

// The output in the console will look something like this:

// ```javascript
// { name2: "Harry", language: "JavaScript" }
// ```

// This output shows the object `a` with its properties and their values. It's a common way to inspect and verify the contents of objects in JavaScript during development and debugging.


let p = {
  run: () => {
    alert("run")
  }
}

p.__proto__ = {
  name: "Jackie"
}

// The line of code `p.__proto__ = { name: "Jackie" }` in JavaScript is setting the prototype of the object `p` to a new object. This statement has important implications for the object's prototype chain and how properties and methods are inherited in JavaScript.

// Here's an explanation of what this code does:

// 1. **Object `p`**:
//    - You have an object named `p`.

// 2. **Setting the Prototype**:
//    - The code `p.__proto__` is used to set the prototype of `p` to a new object, `{ name: "Jackie" }`.

// 3. **New Prototype Object**:
//    - The new object `{ name: "Jackie" }` serves as the prototype for `p`. This means that `p` will inherit the properties and methods of this new object, including the `name` property with the value "Jackie."

// 4. **Implications**:
//    - After this assignment, if you try to access a property on `p`, and it doesn't exist on `p`, JavaScript will follow the prototype chain and look for the property in the prototype object. In this case, it will find the `name` property with the value "Jackie" in the prototype.

// For example, if you were to access the `name` property of `p`:

// ```javascript
// console.log(p.name); // Output: "Jackie"
// ```

// This is because the `name` property is inherited from the prototype object you assigned to `p.__proto__`. In JavaScript, objects can have their prototypes set to other objects, creating a chain of objects that are used to inherit properties and methods. Understanding prototype chains is fundamental for working with objects and inheritance in JavaScript.
