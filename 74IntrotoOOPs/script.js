// The four pillars of  OOPs (object-oriented programming) are 
// data abstraction, 
// encapsulation, 
// inheritance, and 
// polymorphism. 

// Data abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details of an object’s internal structure. By abstracting an object’s data, its structure and behavior can be kept separate and more easily understood.

// Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and related functions into a single unit (object). Encapsulation limits access to object data and methods, preventing their misuse and ensuring their proper functioning.

// Inheritance is the ability to create a new class (child class) from an existing one (parent class). The child class typically inherits the attributes (members and methods) of the parent class, although it can also redefine them. 

// Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a certain interface (have methods of the same name).
